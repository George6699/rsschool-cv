      Hello, I'm 26 years old, I live in Minsk and I wish to change all my life(maybe it's said 
      too loudly). I have been attracted to computer since childhood. But my parents decided to 
      send to the militarysphere. I studied at the BNTU at the military-technical faculty and still 
      work in this speciality. I already took courses in Html, css and js but after seeing a couple 
      of your streams I begin to understand that this is only the tip of the iceberg. I want to learn 
      something new. It's hard sometimes to understend sommething especially in js, but I hope that 
      you will help me with that. I will work hard and I will reach all of my goals. Who knows maybe 
      I can still become part of your team or get into EPAM.
