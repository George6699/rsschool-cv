3. Hello, I wish to change all my life(maybe it's said too loudly). I have been attracted to computers since childhood. But my parents decided to send to the militarysphere. I studied at the BNTU at the military- technical faculty and still work in this speciality. I already took courses in Html, css and js, but after seeing a couple of your streams I begin to understand that this is only the tip of the iceberg. I want to learn something new. It's hard sometimes to understend sommething especially in js, but I hope that you will help me with that. I will work hard and I will reach all of my goals. Who knows maybe I who knows, maybe I can still become part of your team or get into EPAM.
